# hello-world
this is the first repository

My name is Steven Sharpe Jr. Some people call me SSJ. But not everyone which is fine. I'm learning how to code and develop so I can finally get out of my office for good and work on cool projects remotely. I also want to build Enframed to employ creative people in the tech sphere to help fashion & hospitality companies.
